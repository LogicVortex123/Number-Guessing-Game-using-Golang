This is a command-line number guessing game developed in Go.
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.
After each guess, the program tells the user whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
It also keeps track of the number of attempts.

This project demonstrates basic Go programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input, random number generation, and error handling.
